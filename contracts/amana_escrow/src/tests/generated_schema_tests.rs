/// Issue #190 — the contract side of the single event schema source.
///
/// `schemas/events/amana_escrow.events.json` is the one place event topics and
/// fields are declared; `scripts/codegen-events.mjs` generates both the Rust
/// constants used here and the TypeScript decoder the backend runs. These tests
/// tie the running contract to those constants, so a topic rename that is not
/// carried into the schema — and therefore not into the decoder — fails here
/// rather than silently halting settlement in production.
